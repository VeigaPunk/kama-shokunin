# kama-shokunin corpus — index

Proprietary memory for the local model serving & endpoint health domain. Every entry
cites its source (`path:line` or a command + its raw output). Coverage map and open
gaps grow with rounds.

## Coverage map

| Entry | Covers | Round |
|---|---|---|
| `knowledge/listener-census.md` | every loopback TCP listener on this host + its identity verdict | 1 |
| `knowledge/consumer-registry.md` | every config surface that pins a local model baseURL (port, model id, live verdict, owning lane) | 1 |
| `knowledge/endpoint-identity.md` | classification/health decision table: identity vs liveness, readiness signals, probe commands, thresholds | 1 |
| `knowledge/served-model-identity.md` | served-model reconciliation (`/v1/models` vs `--alias` vs configured id) + the minimal proof procedure | 1 |
| `knowledge/drift-timeline.md` | dated reconstruction of the 8080→34113 port move and why consumers never followed | 1 |
| `knowledge/cross-lane-scope.md` | consumer ownership vs sibling lanes, contested scope, handoff lines | 1 |
| `knowledge/alias-endpoint-normalization.md` | canonical alias→endpoint table; whether any dispatch alias can land on a loopback endpoint | 1 |
| `lessons/round-1.md` | round-1 lessons + carry-forward rules | 1 |
| `lessons/round-1-critic.md` | falsification attempt on the round's central claim | 1 |
| `lessons/round-1-citations.md` | independent verification of every frozen fact | 1 |
| `lessons/round-1-safety.md` | adversarial audit: secret leakage, scope/authority, trust boundary | 1 |
| `lessons/probe-mutation-matrix.md` | mutation classes the probe must detect + the classes it misses | 1 |

## Known gaps

- **Operator-dependent:** the stale pins in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json:158`,
  `~/.config/opencode/agents/janitor.md:21`, and `~/.local/bin/the-janitor:19` are
  *detected and reported*, never rewritten by kama (operator-owned files).
- No periodic/automated re-verification yet — `tools/kama-probe.sh` is manual
  (round-2 candidate: turn it into a scheduled freshness check).
- Windows/Podman-style runtimes absent from the census (single-host, Docker only).
- Served-model reconciliation is proven for the llama.cpp runtime only; vLLM/ollama
  runtimes are classified by rule, not measured (`MODEL_OK` vs look-alike stub).
- No coverage of *remote* endpoint health (that is kake/kumitate territory).
